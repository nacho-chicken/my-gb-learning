Thank you for checking out this project!

I feel I covered pretty much everything of note. Obviously there are some
things in particular I didn't go over. Things such as scrolling (one of the
few things I've seen other tutorials go over) and music (it's such a pain that
there's almost no reason not to use a preexisting library). I really enjoyed
learning about this! I don't know if it is an experience I would recommend
for everyone, but if you think it even a little bit interesting, I highly
recommend giving learning Game Boy assembly a shot!

That's about it. Don't have much more to add.
